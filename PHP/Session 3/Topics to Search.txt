- primitives vs non primitives datatypes: 
The answer:
A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null . A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter. The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.

Another answer : 
Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.

- Difference between switch and if-else statements, and which one is faster?


The answer : 
Main Difference between If-else and Switch Case
The main differences between the two are:

The if-else statement is used to choose between two options, but the switch case statement is used to choose between numerous options.

If the condition inside the if block is false, the statement inside the else block is executed. If the condition inside the switch statement is false, the default statements are run.

If-else values are determined by constraints, whereas switch case values are determined by user preferences.

It's difficult to make changes to if-else statements because it's time-consuming to figure out where the change needs to be made. Switch statements, on the other hand, are simple to change since they are easy to trace.

For numerous statements, you can use several if statements. For numerous statements in Switch, you only have one expression.
